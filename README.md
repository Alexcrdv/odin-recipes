# odin-recipes
This is my first project from "The Odin Project" in which I will display the very basic foundations of HTML.
The purpose of this project is to create a basic recipe website which will consist of a main index page with links to a few recipes.
After finishing this project I will write a brief reflection or review of what I've learned below:

This project really put into perspective the work that it takes to actually make a website.  I did something very simple and basic but it still took me a while
to actually create it.  In addition, it also sort of inspired me to keep going and continue to learn.  While making this simple project I kept looking at my
recipe site and thinking I could make it look so much better.  For example, something that really bothered me was the size of the images I took, they were all
different and it just wasn't very pleasing to look at.  Finally, it made me appreciate the process of making a website a lot more in a sense of the work and effort 
that it takes while at the same time making them look how they do.  I have a long way to go, but I'm excited!
